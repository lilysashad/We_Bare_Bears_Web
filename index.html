    <h1>Why Do I Like <em>We Bare Bears</em>?</h1>
    
    <p id="like0">We Bare Bears is such a wholesome program that centers around brotherly love and offers a diverse perspective on life in San Francisco.</p>
        
        <p id="like1">There are numerous instances where the bears are unabashedly affectionate, and support each other like a real family would. For instance,<br>Ice Bear's expression of love manifests in his cooking, or love language in food. Throughout the show, Ice Bear prepares appropriate meals<br>for Grizz and Panda- meat and vegetables, respectively. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClVR4TazKdE" target="_blank"><em>Losing Ice</em></a>, Grizz and Panda take Ice Bear's hard work for granted, causing<br>Ice Bear to feel undervalued, so he takes up a job at a local Japanese grill. In Ice Bear's absence, Grizz and Panda realize their selfishness and<br>finally apologize to Ice Bear, expressing their gratitude for his efforts to care for the family. Aside from Ice Bear's cooking, Grizz continuously<br>supports Panda's pursuits in relationships and passions through various schemes. Although they often fall through, Panda appreciates his brother's<br>attempts. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHPAGjT163M" target="_blank"><em>Panda's Sneeze</em></a>, Panda becomes an Internet sensation when a video of his cute sneeze garners attention. During a "cute-off" <em>(a competition<br>in which one competitor must act more cute than the other)</em> with another Internet sensation, Grizz repeatedly expresses his excitement and pride in<br>Panda for having stepped out of his comfort zone. In addition, Grizz gives Panda moral support and pays him compliments when the latter faces a<br>particular tough spot in the competition.</p>

        <p id="like2">Multiple episodes of the <em>We Bare Bears</em> depict different kinds of people in San Francisco. Since it is a diverse area, sometimes these characters are<br>chilling in the background or actually have roles in that particular episode. For example, side character <strong>Chloe Park</strong> is a 10-year old Korean-American<br>academic prodigy that hangs out with the bears, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n4TVSkoDI0" target="_blank">some episodes</a> respectfully reference her culture. Additionally, the bears occasionally venture into<br>Chinatown and the street decorations/shops accurately reflect the area (based on that one time I visited San Francisco's Chinatown). Lastly, Panda's hobbies<br>offer viewers insight on popular aspects of Japanese and Korean culture- anime and K-pop, respectively. In particular, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9dQ8T2VQEo" target="_blank"><em>Panda's Birthday</em></a> features a cameo from<br>talented K-pop boy group <strong>Monsta X</strong> and producers did not shy away from letting members speak their native language.</p>
